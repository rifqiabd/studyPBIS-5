## Apa topiknya
**Language and Linguistics**

Language is a unique human ability, but its definition and nature can be understood in many different ways. Linguists often define language scientifically, while ordinary people may describe it based on daily experience.

1. In your own experience, how would you define _language_? Please give an example from your daily life that shows why language is more than just words.
2. How do you see the difference between _rules of language_ that are taught in school (for example, grammar rules) and the way people actually use language in real life? Can you share a situation where these two views of language seem to “clash”?   

please use your own words and experiences! if you are using AI for learning please cite as well referring to the [rules of conduct of using AI in tutorial online](https://elearning.ut.ac.id/mod/resource/view.php?id=15657785 "Rules of Conduct of using AI in tutorial online")!
