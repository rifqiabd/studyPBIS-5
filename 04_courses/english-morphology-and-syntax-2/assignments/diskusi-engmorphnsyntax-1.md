## Apa topiknya
Read Aturan Diskusi before working on discussion
In this first session, our discussion topic is morphology and morphemes. 
👉 Discuss with your peers: 
1. You will differentiate between the concept of morphology and other branches of linguistics, such as syntax, semantics, phonology, and pragmatics.
2. You will discuss the types of morphemes including free vs bound morphemes, root morphemes, affixes, inflectional vs derivational morphemes. Specific examples are given to illustrate each type of morpheme.

Note:
1. Don't copy and paste all sentences from the sources. Please paraphrase it!
2. Don't forget to put the references.
3. Keep away from doing plagiarism! 
Have a nice discussion!

In the study of linguistics, morphology is the branch that examines the internal structure of words. How they are formed from the smallest meaningful units called morphemes as Evan Ashworth say in Morphology (part 1)

I find this topic fascinating, and I’d like to connect it with Arabic—specifically with Nahwu and Sharf, which I studied back in the pesantren. Today, I asked ChatGPT about it, and at first, I thought morphology was the same as I’rab, haha. Turns out, my understanding was mistaken. You can see the explanation in [Morpheme vs I’rab.](https://chatgpt.com/share/68edff83-56a8-8012-96d2-20b3feeb14f9)

As one participant [WILSON DOSONO 050364511](https://elearning.ut.ac.id/user/view.php?id=206442&course=167822) in the discussion put it, “Morphology focuses on how words are built,” while other branches like syntax, semantics, phonology, and pragmatics focus on different aspects of language. 

**Comparison with Other Linguistic Branches:**

- **Syntax** deals with how words are arranged into sentences. For example: “She is running fast” vs “Running she fast is.”
- **Semantics** explores the meaning of words and sentences. For instance, “He’s blue” might mean he’s sad, not literally colored blue.
- **Phonology** studies sound systems, such as the contrast between /p/ and /b/.
- **Pragmatics** looks at meaning in context. For example, “Can you pass the salt?” is usually a polite request, not a question about ability.

**Types of Morphemes:**

1. **Free Morphemes**: Can stand alone as words. Examples: “book”, “run”.
2. **Bound Morphemes**: Must attach to other morphemes. Examples: “-s” in “cats”, “un-” in “unhappy”.
3. **Root Morphemes**: The core meaning of a word. Example: “teach” in “teacher”.
4. **Affixes**: Morphemes added to roots.
    - Prefix: “un-” in “undo”
    - Suffix: “-er” in “teacher”
    - Infix (rare in English): “abso-bloody-lutely”
5. **Inflectional Morphemes**: Modify grammatical form without changing word class. Example: “walk” → “walked”.
6. **Derivational Morphemes**: Create new words or change word class. Example: “happy” → “happiness”.

## Table Comparison

### Differences Between Morphology and Other Linguistic Branches

|**Branch**|**Main Focus**|**Difference from Morphology**|
|---|---|---|
|**Morphology**|Internal structure of words and morphemes|Analyzes word forms and the smallest units of meaning|
|**Syntax**|Sentence structure and word arrangement|Focuses on word order and grammatical roles within sentences|
|**Semantics**|Meaning of words and sentences|Concerned with interpretation of meaning, not word structure|
|**Phonology**|Sound systems and patterns in language|Studies sound patterns, not the structure of words|
|**Pragmatics**|Meaning in social and situational context|Highlights how language is used in real-life communication|

### Types of Morphemes and Examples

|**Type of Morpheme**|**Explanation**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Free Morpheme**|Can stand alone as a word|“cat”, “run”|
|**Bound Morpheme**|Must attach to another morpheme|“-s”, “-ed”, “un-”|
|**Root Morpheme**|Core meaning of a word, may be free or bound|“teach” in “teacher”|
|**Affix**|Added to a root (prefix or suffix)|“un-”, “-ing”, “-er”|
|**Derivational Morpheme**|Forms a new word or changes word class|“happy” → “happiness”|
|**Inflectional Morpheme**|Adds grammatical information, doesn’t change class|“walk” → “walked”, “cold” → “coldest”|
